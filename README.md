# Pass The Plate
Pass The Plate is an app designed to allow people who cannot afford food access it from local restaurants. Leftover food, that cannot be sold, is posted on the app by these restaurants, then we show users their local options. While currently in development, we have big plans for Pass The Plate, and cannot wait to share it with the world.
